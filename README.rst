Riptide is a set of tools to manage development environments for web applications.
It's using container virtualization tools, such as `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_
to run all services needed for a project.

It's goal is to be easy to use by developers.
Riptide abstracts the virtualization in such a way that the environment behaves exactly
as if you were running it natively, without the need to install any other requirements
the project may have.

Plugin: Import
--------------

This plugin extends Riptide with improved assistance for project setup and importing data (assets & databases) when
setting up repository.
The plugin requires files to be imported to be present in the same repository. Git LFS is supported.

The plugin uses it's own configuration file ``import.riptide.yml`` to be placed next to the ordinary ``riptide.yml``
project configuration files. See the documentation for more info.

The plugin replaces two Riptide CLI commands:

.. code::

   riptide import-db --help  # new flag --from-repo; also replaces and the alias db-import command.
   riptide import-files --help  # new flag --from-repo

Other than that, the plugin replaces the ``riptide setup`` command with an interactive web
project web setup. The original command can be accessed via the hidden command ``riptide setup-legacy``.
The improved web setup is also available for projects that don't have the ``Ã¬mport.riptide.yml`` configuration file.
